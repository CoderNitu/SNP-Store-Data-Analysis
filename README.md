# SNP-Store-Data-Analysis

Analysis of a sales dataset for a clothing store to extract crucial insights by addressing key questions with MS Excel and prepared an annual sales report by creating a visually appealing dashboard  to help the store understand its customers and grow more sales next year.

 ## METHODOLOGY

## 1. DATA COLLECTION :

     Collected annual sales data for a clothing store and imported it into MS Excel using Power Query for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). We can find the Excel file in my project repo 
     as "Excel Project Dataset"
   
## 2.  DATA CLEANING :

    Check the different columns and rows of the dataset to see whether there are some inconsistent data or anomalies (outliers, missing values) and redundant (duplicate) values. If there 
    is, replace and remove them to have more accurate and efficient results after analysis.
    
## 3.  DATA PROCESSING :

     After data cleaning, we will process or transform the data according to the requirements of data analysis (or which will help to analyze the data later on).
    
## 4. DATA ANALYSIS :

     We will analyze the dataset that we have by solving all the key sample questions. I will provide the questions to my project rep as "Key Questions"
   
## 5. PRESENT THE DATA :

    This is the last step where we will present a report to the client by creating a visually appealing dashboard, in our case an annual sales report after analyzing the dataset with the 
    help of pivot table & pivot chart. We will also provide some crucial insights, which will help the client to understand their last year's sales and customers and increase their 
    sales more in the next year.
